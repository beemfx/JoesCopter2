# Joe's Copter II: The Revenge (ScrollGIN&trade; Demo)

In 2002 the DOS version of Joe's Copter II was abandoned after development of
ScrollGIN Technology. A Joe's Copter II demo was quickly developed in the new
technology, but was shortly abandoned as well. That is why all this repo
contains is a submodle to ScrollGIN.

## History

Originated: January 27, 1999 (Or shortly before that.)

Joe's Copter was kind of a joke of a game being that there was no gameplay, but
I began development on Joe's Copter II shortly after. The original concept came
from a visit I had with one of my dad's friends. Their son had programmed a
helicopter game and that inspired me to make Joe's Copter, but I never made as
nearly as much progress any any of my helicopter games.

The DOS version of Joe's Copter II was heavily influenced by Space Psycho,
anther QBasic game that has floated around the internet. Lots of the code came
from that and that is why Joe's Copter II actually features enemies, whereas the
first game did not.

I actually considered the DOS version to be code complete. All I was going to do
from there was create some screens to serve as levels with some enemies here and
there and then call it a day. I had told my friend my idea for levels and one
level was going to see the helicopter flying inside of a building. My friend
made fun of that design and for whatever reason that discouraged me from further
development of the DOS version.

I started developing ScrollGIN in 2002 (which was heavily based off Ian
Parberry's "Ned's Turkey Farm"). ScrollGIN was being developed for a game called
*Freedom Fighters*, which was to be a Contra clone that I had big plans for. I
suppose I got overwhelmed at that prospect and quickly rebuilt Joe's Copter II
in the engine and that was pretty much the end of ScrollGIN and Joe's Copter II.

I've dabbled with the ScrollGIN source code over the years, at one point
creating a DirectX 11 Renderer for it. That was mostly don't so I could learn
a little about DX11 before using it on 
[Emergence Engine](https://github.com/beemfx/EGEngine).

Recent updates were done more or less for fun. Other than small updates here and
there the core functionality of the game and engine aren't going to be expanded.
