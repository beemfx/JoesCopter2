### Original Readme.txt
<pre>
This is the source code for the original version of Joes Copter 2. Basically it
is a DOS version of ScrollGIN, except that it didn't actually have any
scrolling. Instead you moved from screen to screen. This code was inspired by
Hacksoft's game Space Psycho. ScrollGIN is significantly better designed. That
said, ScrollGIN isn't that well designed.

The folder "Old" contains even older code than the Joes Copter II source.

moveen.bas - This is a very early version of ScrollGIN.
